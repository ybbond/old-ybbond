Remaking my personal site,
previously was [reason.ybbond.dev](https://reason.ybbond.dev).

Now, it is [old.ybbond.dev](https://old.ybbond.dev).

My main site right now is [ybbond.dev](https://ybbond.dev).

ReasonReact was fun, but I must admit it is hard.

The main intention of this remake is to implement latest technologies
of React, without the obstacles I encountered when I try to make it with Reason.
